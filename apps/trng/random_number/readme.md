# TRNG random number

This example application shows how to use the TRNG Peripheral library to generate and read a random number.

## Description

This example application shows how to use the TRNG peripheral library to produce a 32-bit true random number. Generated random number can be used as an entropy source for seeding a Deterministic Random Number Generator (DRNG), creating cryptographic keys for ciphers etc.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_a7g5) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/trng/random_number/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_a7g5_ek.X | [SAMA7G5 Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails) |

### Setting up [SAMA7G5 Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails)

#### Setting up the board

- Connect an oscilloscope to clock output pin
- Connect a 5V power supply to the board. This can be either of the following:
    - A USB cable connected between "USBA" (J7) connector on the board and USB host port on PC 
    - A 5V DC adapter connected to "5V DC IN" (J1) connector on board 
- Connect the Debug USB port (J24) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer.
2. Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and run the application using its IDE
4. The console displays the following message

    ![output](images/output_trng_random_number_1.png)

5. Every time the switch is pressed, a new 32 bit random number is generated and displayed on the console
