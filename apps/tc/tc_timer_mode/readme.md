### Setting up [SAMA7G5 Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails)

#### Setting up the board

- Connect a 5V power supply to the board. This can be either of the following:
    - A USB cable connected between "USBA" (J7) connector on the board and USB host port on PC 
    - A 5V DC adapter connected to "5V DC IN" (J1) connector on board 
- Connect the Debug USB port (J24) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and run the application using its IDE
5. Observe that the LED blinks once every second

Refer to the following table for LED name:
