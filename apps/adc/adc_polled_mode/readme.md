# ADC Polling

This example application shows how to sample an analog input in polled mode and send the converted data to console.

## Description

In this example, Analog input voltage in the range of 0 V to 3.3 V is fed to the ADC and converted value is displayed on the console. The ADC conversion is triggered by software and result is polled using status API.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_a7g5) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/adc/adc_polled_mode/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| sam_a7g5_ek.X | MPLABX project for [SAMA7G5 Evaluation Kit]() |
|||

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_a7g5_ek.X | [SAMA7G5 Evaluation Kit]() |
|||

### Setting up [SAMA7G5 Evaluation Kit]()

#### Setting up the board

- Connect the USB port J7 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)
- Connect the USB port J24 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to enable debug com port)
- AD5 pin is used for analog input
- Use a jumper wire to connect Pin 11 (SDA pin) of mikroBUS 2 connector (AD5 is used for input and is mapped to Port Pin PC18) to 3.3 V or GND

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer.
3. Connect to the Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
4. Console displays ADC Count and ADC Input Voltage
