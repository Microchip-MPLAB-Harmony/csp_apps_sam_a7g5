# ADC Polling

This example application shows how to sample an analog input in polled mode and send the converted data to console.

## Description

In this example, Analog input voltage in the range of 0 V to 3.3 V is fed to the ADC and converted value is displayed on the console. The ADC conversion is triggered by software and result is polled using status API.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_a7g5) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/adc/adc_polled_mode/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| sam_a7g5_ek.X | MPLABX project for [SAMA7G5 Evaluation Kit]() |
|||

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_a7g5_ek.X | [SAMA7G5 Evaluation Kit]() |
|||

### Setting up [SAMA7G5 Evaluation Kit]()

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](firmware/at91bootstrap_sam_a7g5_ek.X/binaries/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1 (J4)
- Connect the USB port J7 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)
- Connect the USB port J24 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to enable debug com port)
- AD5 pin is used for analog input
- Use a jumper wire to connect Pin 11 (SDA pin) of mikroBUS 2 connector (AD5 is used for input and is mapped to Port Pin PC18) to 3.3 V or GND

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer.
5. Connect to the Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
6. Reset the board to run the application'
7. Console displays ADC Count and ADC Input Voltage
